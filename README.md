# PointVector

A PointVector is a vector anchored at a point. Useful for complex graphics calculations as well as user interfaces which allow dragging along an arbitrary line (e.g. to resize an object proportionally).  This package also adds many methods to CGVector (which PointVector is based on).

Depends on the Angle package (https://github.com/UXJon/Angle).
